Gatsby + Shopify + Sanity powered eCommerce site for Article One Eyewear

This project was boilerplated from this [gatsby-sanity-shopify](https://github.com/lucasvocos/gatsby-sanity-shopify) repo, which pairs together a Sanity Studio and generates Product & Variant creation in Sanity when receiving webhooks from Shopify. 

HUGE thanks to üçù [Kevin Green](https://github.com/iamkevingreen) üçù for his work with Sanity + Shopify and the `functions/shopify.js` file
